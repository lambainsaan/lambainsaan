### Hi there 👋


✨ Rhitik ✨, here. People call me Rhitik, RB, or LambaInsaan. I am a Software Developer currently working at [CommerceIQ.ai](www.commerceiq.ai). I had previously worked at [RivetLabs.io](www.rivetlabs.io), and [Skylarkdrones](www.skylarkdrones.com) including a very short stint at [Delhivery](www.delhivery.com).

I mostly code in Python, and TypeScript, and I am dipping my toes in the Goland right now, but I am language agnostic. Except for racket, I hate the b-racket overloading, sorry to break your heart if you love racket. 💔😛

I have diverse experience, I worked purely in the frontend in some of the organizations, and currently, I am working purely on the backend side of things, building the future of e-commerce. 🚀

## About me 😬

I am very passionate about online education, personally, online education has changed my life around, and I feel very indebted to the organizations that helped me fulfill my dreams. I want to do something in the field of education sometime in my life, not really sure when? 🤔

I love open-source, and I very much support the people who make my life better with their code. I contribute bits and pieces to VSCode, I want to contribute a lot to the VSCode codebase, since it helps me tons with productivity. Also, I have great respect for the python community, I would like to help people over there as well.

I love writing, I always wanted to create a blog and post shizzz over there, but never invested the time on it. I might as well add my posts in this wiki, once I do start writing blogs. 😁
